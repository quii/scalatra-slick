# slickfun #

Quick example project of using scala slick with scalatra. Obviously not the best idea to have db code living in your controllers but this is strictly for demo only :)

## Build & Run ##

```sh
$ cd slickfun
$ ./sbt
> container:start
> browse
```

If `browse` doesn't launch your browser, manually open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser.
